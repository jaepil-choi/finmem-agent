# Read-Only Reference Directories

To maintain the integrity of reference materials and tutorial code, the following directories are strictly **read-only**.

### Restricted Directories
- `FinMem-LLM-StockTrading-main/`
- `langgraph-v1-tutorial/`

### Rules
1. **Never Write**: Do not create new files or modify existing files within these directories.
2. **Never Delete**: Do not delete any files or subdirectories within these paths.
3. **Reference Only**: Use these files solely for reading, analysis, and as a basis for implementation in other parts of the project.
4. **Prefer Python Files**: When referencing content in `langgraph-v1-tutorial/`, **always read the `.py` version** instead of the `.ipynb` version. The `.ipynb` files are JSON-formatted and consume significantly more tokens. Use the corresponding `.py` file (e.g., read `tutorial.py` instead of `tutorial.ipynb`) for all analysis and code extraction.

### Why?
These directories contain external reference implementations and tutorial materials that should remain in their original state. Using `.py` files instead of `.ipynb` optimizes token usage and improves processing efficiency. Any modifications should be made in a separate project directory.
