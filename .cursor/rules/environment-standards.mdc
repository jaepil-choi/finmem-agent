# Environment & Package Management Standards

- **Shell**: Use **PowerShell** for all terminal operations. Avoid Linux-specific commands.
- **Execution**: Always use `uv run python` to execute Python scripts. Never run `python` directly in the terminal.
- **Package Manager**: Use **uv** exclusively for environment and package management.
  - **CRITICAL**: Never use `pip install`.
  - Always use `uv add` for managing dependencies.
- **Installations**: Always request **explicit user confirmation** before running any command that installs, updates, or modifies packages.
